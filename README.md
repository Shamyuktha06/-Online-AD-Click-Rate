# 🧠 Online Ad Click Rate Prediction - IBM Challenge

## 🔍 Overview
This project predicts whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on features such as age, daily internet usage, device type, and more. This is a classification problem solved using supervised machine learning techniques.

## 🗂️ Dataset
Example features:
- `Daily Time Spent on Site`
- `Age`
- `Area Income`
